        <h1>
          San Diego County will need to house <b>1,000,000 more</b> residence by 2050*
        </h1>

        </p>
        <p>
          Current housing projections by San Diego Association of Governments
          (SANDAG) show that San Diego County will need to house one million
          more residents by 2050, which equates to approximately 350,000 new
          housing units. Facing an expensive housing market with such a critical
          shortage of affordable housing, the SD County Behavioral Health Housing
          Council (SDC BHHC) and AIA San Diego (AIA SD) have teamed up to
          demonstrate how tiny homes and modular housing can serve as alternative
          housing solutions to address this real problem.  This solution is not
          a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather an additional methodology to
          help address and resolve the housing crisis facing current and future
          residents of San Diego County.

        <h1>
          Use <b>tiny house communities</b> as an efficient, affordable living
          situation that residents can benefit from and be proud of
        </h1>
        <p>
          Why tiny homes and modular construction?  With their increase in
          popularity, tiny homes and modular units have been the topic of
          countless articles and discussions about how living a simplified
          lifestyle can increase health outcomes. The typical solutions for
          affordable housing are multistory high-occupancy structures, which
          require extensive planning and development costs. Tiny homes and
          modular housing units can also allow for the creation of small
          communities with lower development costs, foster independence and
          positive decision-making of one’s own surroundings and bolster an
          individual’s pride given their autonomous home occupancy.
